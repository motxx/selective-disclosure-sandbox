    title: "Threshold Network To Integrate Chainlink Proof of Reserve",
    body: `Threshold Network is excited to announce the planned integration
      of Chainlink Proof of Reserve with the tBTC v2 bridge on Ethereum
      mainnet to help securely monitor BTC deposits. With this integration
      of the industry-leading decentralized network, Chainlink nodes will be
      able to read the amount of Bitcoin custodied in the tBTC reserves
      wallets to help inform dApp users. This automated verification will
      help enable tBTC holders and DeFi apps accepting tBTC as collateral
      to verify that every tBTC minted is fully backed by BTC at a rate of
      1:1.`,

      selected to perform work on the protocol. The Chaosnet sequence is
      designed to steadily test the network at increasing usage levels, opening
      it up to more and more participants. This is intended to provide a
      progressive path to full decentralization while testing and reinforcing
      the network's strength and security at every step of the way. The
      Chaosnet sequence going forward will be as follows`,

    title: "Three Pillars of DAO Treasury Management",
    body: `Effective treasury management essentially boils down to one
      fundamental principle: defending against volatility. What is meant by
      volatility in this context is simply how frequently and dramatically the
      net worth of all assets contained within a treasury rises and falls. Too
      much volatility in a treasury makes it very difficult for a DAO to create
      any long-term plans and goals that require resources, since what
      resources will be available in the future is uncertain.`,

      Previously, a majority of rewards have been allocated to Threshold’s
      first product, PRE. As a result of this proposal, rewards will now be
      rebalanced towards tBTC over time to support the full rollout of the

    body: `Something changed, slowly but surely, to the term ‘cheater’ over
      the course of the centuries. Originally, the word ‘cheater’ used to
      refer to something quite technical and specific; namely; a particular
      Royal Office. In the 14th century, a “cheater”, or “escheater” was
      someone in charge of the king’s escheats; land that would revert in
      ownership to the crown, in certain cases of succession, when an owner
      died without clear, legal heirs.`,

    body: `Most modern chat programs (and forums) have the concept of "chat
      channels"; which is essentially the ability to categorize by subject.
      Chat channels let you keep your discussions about business development
      in one channel and your debates over solidity gas optimizations in
      another. If everyone is chatting in one single, shared channel about
      everything, things quickly devolve into total chaos. So, having a single
      channel for discussion was never an option.`,
